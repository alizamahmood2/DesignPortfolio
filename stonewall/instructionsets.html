<div class="alltext"><h1>Instruction Sets for Stonewall</h1>
<h3 class="subtitle"><br>Pair Project - New York, 2018<br><br>Course: Major Studio I</h3>


<p>This project is about a series of wooden frames, installed in Christopher Park, New York, meant to highlight different histories of the park and provoke thought.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>We started off by researching the history of the place. Christopher Park is mostly known for being located across the street from the Stonewall Inn which is famous because of the 1969 Stonewall Riots. However, the place has much deeper and layered histories than that. It is indigenous land that was once a tobacco farm (1630s), saw class struggles in the 1800s, had a civil war monument installed in 1936 and the gay liberation monument installed in 1992.
</p>

<div class="gridcontainer">

	<div class="photo">

  	</div>

  	<p class="text2">We sat in the park for a few hours and observed the behavior patterns of the people. Its a very small intimate space and most people come to Christopher park to eat, sit, meet friends, or pass through while taking photos of the Gay Liberation Monument. We noticed that most people followed the same path to enter the park, pause at the same spot in front of the liberation monument, take a quick photo, and then exit from the side.</p>

	<div class="photo">
		<img src="image/2.png" class="image">
  	</div>

  	<div class="text2"><p class="boldtext">Observations:</p><p>The architecture of the whole space dictated this behavior:
  		<br><br> 1. Even though the Gay Liberation monument is in honor of Stonewall, you can’t really clearly see the Inn from inside the park.
  		<br><br> 2. The civil war monument is mostly ignored because it is beyond the fence, so you can’t really walk past it and so the bronze statue blurs into the plants from afar.
  		<br><br> 3. The skyline is interestingly low.
  		<br><br> 4. The monument is positioned in a way that people do not interact with it from multiple sides, so many details go unnoticed.</p>
 		
 		<p><br>Therefore, what we aimed to do with our installations was to ‘frame’ different parts of the park, to highlight some of the layered histories of the place and have people holistically experience the park.</p>

 		<p>Our first prototype was made from cardboard. Two of the five frames we installed on the fence, while the other three required better stands to withstand the wind and so we could only install two frames on our first go. Each frame was also paired with a set of footprints on the ground to indicate where to stand and look through.</p></div>

  	<div class="text2"><p class="boldtext">First Prototypes:</p><p>o Left: The frame with the shot of the civil war monument was successful and grasped people’s attention. Some people took photos through it.
  		<br><br>o Right: The other frame at the side entrance just blended into the environment and did not catch people’s attention as they passed by. However, the few who did notice, were pleasantly surprised by what it framed.</p>

  	<div class="text2"><p>20 hours in woodshop later...</p>

  	<p><br>We constructed our second prototype out of wood, and we decorated some of the frames in bright flashy textures to symbolize gay pride and catch people’s attention, even as they're passing by.</p></div>

  	<div class="text2"><p class="boldtext">Second Prototypes:</p><p>
  				Frame 1: Framed the civil war monument (2' x 2'), attached to the fence, and left as plain wood.

  		<br><br>Frame 2: The two way frame, (4' x 2'), attached to a dismantle-able stand, covered with a mirrored surface.

  		<br><br>Frame 3: The one at one of the side entrances (3' x 2'), that framed the gay liberation monument from the back, painted with brightly colored pattern, attached to the fence.

  		<br><br>Frame 4: Framed the skyline (2' x 2'), attached to a dismantle-able stand, painted bright blue with a blue-tinted transparent layer of plastic forming the silhouette of the NYC skyscrapers, in contrast to the low skyline.

  		<br><br>Frame 5: Framed the gay liberation monument from the side with Stonewall in the background (3' x 3'), attached to a dismantle-able stand, covered with pink iridescent paper.

  	<div class="text2"><p>We noticed that people interacted more if they saw other people interacting with it first. It was also interesting to see strangers interact through the two way frame. The video shows some of the 98 interactions we had in 2.5 hours.</p>

  	<p><br>Conclusively, while we may not have gotten people to really know all the overlapping histories of the place, we did however successfully get them to view the space from different perspectives, hopefully prompting them to ask questions about what the frame frames and why, for the few seconds that they stood there.</p>
