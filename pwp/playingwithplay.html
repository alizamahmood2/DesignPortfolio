	<h1 class="heading">Playing with Play</h1>
<h3 class="subtitle">Group Project - Copenhagen, March 2019<br><br>Instructors: John Sharp, Nancy Nowacek, Jesper Juul<br><br><br><br>In collaboration with:<br><br>The Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts (KADK)<br><br>National Gallery of Denmark (SMK)</h3>


<p>This course employed creative research strategies derived from social practice art, participatory design, and the iterative design process to consider expanded notions of play. We were asked to 'create objects of play that address the social forms of the National gallery of Denmark. Can play be found inside the social forms of daily life? Can creative practice function as a form of research? Can the creative process itself become an object of play?'
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>We created a performance piece that we ran twice at the museum - once on a Wednesday afternoon and another on a Friday evening. As the atmosphere, flow and experience of the classical and contemporary sections were very different, we chose to focus our project on the classical section only. This consisted of these sub-sections: European Art, 1300-1800; French Art, 1900-1930; Danish and Nordic Art, 1750-1900; Danish and International Art, after 1900.</p>

	<div class="text2"><p class="boldtext">Iteration 1:</p></div>

	<div class="photo">
		<img src="image/1.jpg" class="image">
  	</div>

  	<p class="text2">
  	This was a series of plain gray masks that each had different clues attached to them, regarding a painting in one of the sections. They came with instructions that prompted people to ‘enter the performance’ by putting on a mask and following through with the clues. Once they were done, they had to pass the mask onto another person.
  	</p>

  	<div class="text2"><p class="boldtext">Observations:</p>
		<p>* The mask automatically implied silence and so people would take it off, if they had to converse with someone next to them.
		<br><br> * Having a bunch of people wearing masks and silently engaging with the art in different ways was really provocative and intriguing to the visitors who didn’t have a mask on.
		<br><br> * The masks had a very intense look to them and just watching someone walk by wearing a mask changed the atmosphere of the space, and added a different layer to view art through.
		<br><br> * The instructions and clues were hard to decipher and that made the intervention unapproachable.
		<br><br> * There was also some ambiguity with the instructions. Here, this uncertainty was taking away from the experience. We tried to convert this into open-endedness rather than uncertainty in the next iteration.
		<br><br> * Passing off the mask once you’re done was an exciting part (based on multiple interviews and observations), because it became a ritual and caused the mask to circulate within the classical wing.
	</p></div>

	<div class="text2"><p class="boldtext">Iteration 2:</p></div>

  	<div class="photo">
		<img src="image/2.JPG" class="image">
  	</div>

  	<p class="text2">The gray masks stood out because of the color. But they could also potentially have connotations of violence attached that we wanted to detach this project from. Therefore, we decorated the masks with bright colors that would also stand out in the classical section but not be a frightening thing to see someone in.</p>

  	<div class="photo">

  	</div>

  	<p class="text2">We also created invites that were kept at various points in the museum (entrance, stairways etc.). We gave it a very silly title: 'Mask-a-choose-its', to encourage people to enage with our project.</p>

  	<div class="photo">
		<img src="image/5.png" class="image">
  	</div>

  	<p class="text2">^These are some of the prompts.</p>


  	<p class="text2">We simplified the instructions and made the prompts very open-ended and simple, while still maintaining a sense of intrigue with the phrasing.</p>

  	<div class="photo">
		<img src="image/6.JPG" class="image">
  	</div>

  	<p class="text2">We placed these masks at multiple parts within the different sections in the classical wing and started off the performance by each of us (6 people), wearing a mask, performing the tasks and passing it onto another person. We then unobtrusively observed people’s behavior. However, we decided to leave after a while, so as to not interfere with the performance and let it flow. We returned after an hour to find all 22 masks were in circulation!</p>

  	<div class="photo">
		<img src="image/7.JPG" class="image">
  	</div>

  	<div class="text2"><p class="boldtext">Feedback:</p>
		<p>* Passing off the mask really got the flow going and somewhat created a shared understanding between visitors.
		<br><br>* Majority of the people engaged with the masks and the performance, while a few did not.
		<br><br>* We interviewed some people afterword and the main feedback we received was that it was exciting to be part of the performance but it was also intriguing to be a spectator noticing someone else doing something with the mask.
		<br><br>* While a few people didn’t put on the mask and performed the tasks while holding the mask, many would only take off the mask once they had completed the task.

  	<div class="text2"><p>It was really fun to explore how strangers could either become part of a silent performance, or spectators of that performance, and to observe how their perception of the museum could possibly change in different ways based on that.</p>

  		<p><br></p>

	<p>The masks and their tasks also changed some of the social forms of the museum. For example, the flow of people moving was previously homogenized and slow, while this performance added a bit of dynamism and energy to the spaces and the flow deviated from the default in curious ways.</p>
