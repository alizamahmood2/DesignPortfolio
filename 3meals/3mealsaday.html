<p>We planned to explore how we might maintain a connection with nature, and what that connection might mean, in a future in which techno-determinist resiliency is the status quo. This was both an exploration of our notions of connection, and a critical analysis of a probable future where an artificial intimacy with nature may emerge.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>Following is a plausible story of food innovation in three parts. We’ll start by establishing precedents in 2038. We’ll discuss the designed innovation in 2050. And then we’ll show possible downstream effects in 2100.

  	<div class="text2"><p class="boldtext">Ryan:</p><p class="italic">So, before I got involved in politics as a lobbyist, I grew up on a cattle ranch. One of the last cattle ranches in the US, in fact.</p>

  	<p class="italic">Now, as we all know, there are a lot of reasons that there aren’t any cattle ranches anymore. But a lot of it had to do with these numbers. Livestock became a scapegoat, so to speak. As the effects of a changing climate became more and more personal throughout the 2020s. Here in America, people were looking for something or someone to blame.</p></div>

  	<div class="photo">
		<img src="image/2.png" class="image">
  	</div>

  	<div class="text2"><p class="italic">And of course, there were plenty of companies who were ready to make a quick buck off of this. This is early promotional material from a company called “Impossible Foods”. Many of these anti-meat food innovations relied heavily on soy products for their taste, texture, and nutritional value.</p></div>


  	<div class="photo">
		<img src="image/3.png" class="image">
  	</div>

  	<div class="text2"><p class="italic">And so, as the cattle ranches closed, many of the lands were converted into fields for genetically modified soybean crop, going against the wishes of many, who had assumed that these lands would be stewarded, or set aside for rewilding.</p></div>

  	<div class="photo">
		<img src="image/4.png" class="image">
  	</div>

  	<div class="text2"><p class="italic">And, now, soybeans are sort of a strange crop in that they benefitted greatly from the effects of climate change. More CO2 in the atmosphere meant greater yields, but more extreme heat events meant that these crops needed much, much more water. And, as we blow past the 1.5-degree change and into 2-degree territory (and beyond), these yields start to falter.</p>

  	<p class="italic">So, this didn’t go unnoticed by waters-rights activists and together…</p></div>

  	<div class="text2"><p class="italic">In the late 20-teens and early 2020’s Tyson’s Food had a burgeoning research and development arm specifically dedicated to cell-cultured food production. However, this operation was shuttered in the late 2020’s as plant-based foods took over the market. However, in 2040 Tyson Foods started to partner with the Department of Food Security, and in the ten years that followed we have become the nation’s primary supplier of New Nature Foods.</p></div>

  	<div class="text2"><p class="boldtext">Aliza:</p><p class="italic">Hi, I work for the Tyson Food Industry and today I’m here to tell you about our food packages. But first, let’s take a look at the role of food in our lives today in 2050.</p>

  	<p class="italic">A lot has changed over the past 20 years or so, but we still strive to maintain a connection with food. We don’t just eat when we’re hungry. we eat when we are sad, happy, or semi-conscious binge-watching a show. When it comes to food, it sits on an emotional level first before being an instinctive need for humans. And as we move towards ultra-convenience with advancing technology, we still want to maintain our deep connection with food.</p>

  	<p class="italic">So, let me introduce you to the three amazing packages we have! There’s basic, standard and deluxe.</p></div>


  	<div class="photo">
		<img src="image/9.png" class="image">
  	</div>

  	<div class="text2"><p class="italic">The basic has the maximum nutrition, while the deluxe has the least. But with each level, the degree of human connection is elevated due to the increase in the amount of time spent on consuming the food, the richness in flavor, visual nostalgia and the social context of consuming food while sitting together.</p>

  	<p class="italic">The basic is super convenient, perfectly adjusted to your health and bodily needs and you can easily grab them any time from a store near you.</p>

	<p class="italic">The standard is our most popular package, because what it lacks in flavor, it makes up for with customization to match your specific taste profiles. And if you concentrate and try to feel the slight texture on the surface of the disks, I assure you, you will enjoy your food! It’s also larger in size than the basic, so that you can take a few minutes to chew and eat so you can get together with other people to consume it.</p>

	<p class="italic">Finally, our greatest package, the deluxe! You may buy this at any neighborhood food hub. The service is incredible and the taste and scent is elevated. It fosters the most amount of human connection and the textural projections on the surface are very realistic, so it’s very authentic that way.</p>

	<p><br></p>

  	<p>Now, fast forwarding to 2100 - these are some extrapolations of the speculative world from 2050. This is not meant to be a snapshot of an accurate future, but rather a somewhat plausible future, shown to provoke thought and to discuss what can be learned from this alternative food landscape.</p></div>

  	<div class="text2"><p>In taking this holistic, speculative, approach which blended policy, product design, economics, and the urban perspective, we hoped to explore the futures of synthetic biofoods. In our design practice and studies, we are often driven to arrive at solutions. Through this approach, what we arrived at, instead, is a question:</p>

	<p>Are food innovations the ultimate solution for problems of climate, hunger, nature, and the progression of humankind?</p></div>
