<h3 class="subtitle">Individual Studio Project - New York, 2019</h3>
<!-- <h2>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h2> -->
<p>This project is an exploration into discursive walking* practices in neighborhoods of New York City. It explores this through the perspective of one individual that is walking through a larger collective of social forms.<br><br>We make sense of a city or a neighborhood, by walking through it. It’s one of the most grounded ways to experience a place and it offers a dynamic viewpoint to design with and for. This project focuses on sounds of walks, as a form of passive sensory journaling, to then later be used to create a space for reflection and retrospective journaling. This exploration into walking is intended to enrich impressions of place, familiarity, awareness and presence. 
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="italic">*Discursive Walking - This type of walk allows you to be present enough in your walking practice to be perceptible to the materiality of the space around you as it shifts which each step. It is neither single-purposed nor purposeless. It allows the walker to be receptive to the walk itself, going beyond the purpose of transportation. 
</p>

  	<div class="text2"><p>This is an artifact that plays the sounds from your walks when you clip on a fabric from the library of neighborhoods. Each fabric contains sounds of a different walk. This is meant to create an auditory space for reflection and retrospective journalling of these walks.</p> 

  	<p>The pattern of the spirals on each fabric is slightly distorted or in a different shape to reflect the mood of the walker at the time of the walk. This physical distortion can also produce slightly different aesthetics of sounds.</p> </div>

  	<div class="text2"><p>I recorded my walks in 6 different neighborhoods in Downtown Manhattan: Union Square, Chelsea, West Village, East Village, Lower East Side, SoHo. My pace was dependent on my mood which was influenced by the weather, my energy level and state of mind. All these variables made the walks sound different and had characteristic sounds of that particular neighborhood.</p></div>

  	<div class="text2"><p>EXHIBITION: This artefact was exhibited in the end of semester pop-up showcase at Parsons School of Design. Even though this artefact is meant for an individual, in this exhibition setting, it was tested with multiple people. They listened to the sounds of walks and journalled down their reflections. This created a collective journal of different neighborhoods.</p>

  	<p>While the responses can be regarded as separate and viewed as tests for an individual experience, I observed that there was great value in people going through other’s responses and having that add to their overall mood and experience. And in the end, this manifested as a collection of different thoughts representative of one neighborhood, really capturing a larger sense of place. </p></div>

  	<div class="text2"><p>FEEDBACK: The participants were delighted to hear sounds the instant they clipped on the fabric with the paper clip to the Walking Record Player. Most people realized that it was a soft circuit but were still pleasantly surprised to have material work that way. One person really enjoyed holding up the artifact to his ear and remarked ‘it’s so rare these days that you actually get to hold something to listen to it, and build that connection’. One person wanted to see where they were in the walk at every point to build an even deeper connection. Other responses from people included how the sounds helped situate them into the neighborhood in their minds and imagine themselves there.</p></div>

  	<div class="text2">
  	<p>Even though I started off as designing for walking, eventually I was designing through walking. I was recording, editing and reflecting as I walked and my walks created the content for the project. I was delighted to realise that I used walking as a design method.</p>
